# Ben's DIM Wishlists
This contains a DIM wishlist that was created with the intent to provide advice to players who are not just chasing the 5/5 God Roll. 
The default DIM wishlist only indicates when you have a 5/5 God Roll, and not a useful roll.

The goal of this wishlist is to identify rolls of guns that may be 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, or 4/5 and be useful to the player while they are still chasing the 5/5 God Roll. This will give players a more granular overview of their inventory and allow them to make better decisions around what to keep and use, as opposed to the default wishlist's all or nothing approach.

For example: A Zaouli's Bane with Incandescent is still a useful gun for someone who doesn't have a better roll, and this wishlist will indicate that in DIM.
